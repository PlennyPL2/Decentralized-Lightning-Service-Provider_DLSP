        <h1>Plenny DLSP</h1>

        <div class="description">
            <p>Plenny DLSP refers to the multifunctional open-source software for providing the decentralized lightning
                services of the Dapp and the DON in order to process transaction data off-chain.
                This add-on module for lightning nodes supports both, Lightning Oracles and Liquidity Makers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lightning Oracles and Liquidity Makers download and install the same open-source software to operate
                as Plenny DLSPs. This specifically designed add-on module supports processing data off-chain for the
                provision of services over the DON and the capacity market. For integration, lightning nodes install an
                executable application and configure the tool on their device. Depending on the configuration, the service
                level and user type are recognized when connecting with the Dapp. Participating in the DON to operate as an
                oracle validator is permission-less, and so is the participation in the capacity market to operate as a
                Liquidity Maker. Any lightning node can run a Plenny DLSP.
            </p>

            <p>
                Participating lightning nodes operating as Plenny DLSP improve economics for potential fee income in
                Satoshi (sat) while earning additional income in Plenny (PL2) over DeFi. Operating as a Plenny DLSP
                involves the use of both, sat and PL2.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to operate as a Plenny DLSP, lightning nodes must first complete the initial verification.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ETH_Wallet that is used from the DLSP should NOT be used for any other transactions
                (e.g on DEXes or other Dapps) to avoid nonce errors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Plenny is reachable over HTTPS for secure communication. If you don't have an SSL certificate installed
                on your endpoint for the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON), you'll have to use HTTP to access it.
                As a result, all standard web browsers will reject this access and classify it as "unsafe".
                Moreover, Plenny will receive an error and respond accordingly. This issue is classified as
                "Mixed Content Warnings" over the web browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                Make sure your endpoint for the DON is accessible through HTTPS to avoid this issue. You can use
                commercial or free SSL certificates. The SSL configurations listed below can be used:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Using a Proxy webserver [Examples : HAProxy, Nginx]
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cloud load balancer with Cloud provider's SSL [For cloud-hosted Decentralized Oracle Network]
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dockerised solution using docker-compose [nginx server with Letâ€™s Encrypt]
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Liquidity Makers utilize a specifically designed add-on module that supports processing data off-chain.
                This feature enables Lightning Nodes to participate in Plenny's capacity market as so-called DLSP and at
                the same time to operate independently via the LN. For integration, lightning nodes install an executable
                application to run the pre-configured software on their device. Any lightning node can download the
                open-source software and connect. Participating in the capacity market and operating as an LM is
                permission-less.
            </p>
