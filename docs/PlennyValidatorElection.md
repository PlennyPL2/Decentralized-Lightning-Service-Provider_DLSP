Reserves a reward for a given validator as a result of a oracle validation done on-chain.




- `validator`: to reserve reward for

- `oracleChannelReward`: the reward amount



### `setNewElectionPeriod(uint256 amount)` (external)

- `amount`: election period, in blocks



### `setMaxValidators(uint256 amount)` (external)

Changes the maximum number of validators. Called by the owner.




- `amount`: validators



### `setUserRewardPercent(uint256 amount)` (external)

Changes the user reward in percentage. Called by the owner.




- `amount`: amount percentage for the user



### `getElectedValidatorsCount(uint256 electionBlock) â†’ uint256` (external)

Gets elected validator count per election.




- `electionBlock`: block of the election
